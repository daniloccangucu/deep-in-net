# Routing Tables

## What is a routing table and what is its role?

- A routing table is a data table stored in a router or a networked computer. It lists the available routes to specific network destinations, along with metrics and next-hop information. Its role is to determine the best path for forwarding packets based on destination IP addresses, facilitating efficient data transmission across networks.
