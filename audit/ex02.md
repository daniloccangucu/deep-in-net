# Networking Devices

## What is the function of a switch, how does it operate and what is its role in networking?

- Switches forward data packets between devices in a network based on MAC addresses. They operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Their role is to improve network efficiency by creating dedicated communication paths.

## What is the function of a hub, how does it operate and what is its role in networking?

- Hubs simply broadcast data to all connected devices without any intelligence or decision-making. They operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. Their role is to provide basic connectivity, but they can lead to network congestion and decreased performance.

## What are the differences between a hub and a switch?

- Differences between a hub and a switch include how they handle data:
  - A switch selectively forwards data based on MAC addresses.
  - A hub broadcasts data to all connected devices.
  - Switches are more efficient and offer better performance compared to hubs.

## Can you identify the OSI model layer that the switch and the hub operate on?

- Switches operate at Layer 2 (data link layer) of the OSI model, while hubs operate at Layer 1 (physical layer).
