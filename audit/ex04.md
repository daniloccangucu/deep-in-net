# Router Concepts

## Router Role

- A router is like a traffic cop for the internet, directing data between different networks to make sure it gets to the right place. It determines the best path for data packets to travel across interconnected networks.

## Switch vs. Router

- A switch connects devices within a single network, like the rooms in a house, ensuring data gets to the right device based on their MAC addresses.
- A router connects different networks together, like different houses in a neighborhood, guiding data between them based on IP addresses.

## Router OSI Layer

- Routers work on the third layer of the OSI model, known as the network layer (Layer 3). They handle logical addressing, routing, and forwarding of data packets between networks.

## Default Gateway

- Think of the default gateway as the door to the internet for your device. It's like the address you need to reach the outside world from your home network. The default gateway is typically set to the router's IP address, guiding your data in and out of your network to communicate with devices on other networks.
