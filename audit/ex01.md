# Networking Basics

## What is a RJ-45 cable?

- A RJ-45 cable is a type of CAT5 cable with RJ-45 connectors at each end, used for connecting devices in a local area network (LAN). It adheres to either the T568A or T568B standards and is one of the most common types of network cable.

## What is the difference between straight through and crossover RJ-45 cables?

- Straight through cables are used to connect devices of different types, such as a computer to a router or a DSL modem. They have the same pinout on both ends. Crossover cables, on the other hand, are used to connect devices of the same type, like two computers or two switches, and have their pinouts crossed over on one end.

## How are the IP addresses calculated?

- IP addresses are calculated based on the subnet mask and the network address. The subnet mask determines how many bits of the IP address are used for the network part and how many are used for host addresses within that network. The network address is the first address in the subnet, and the host addresses are the subsequent addresses. The calculation involves converting the subnet mask to binary and counting the number of ones to determine the number of host addresses in the subnet.
